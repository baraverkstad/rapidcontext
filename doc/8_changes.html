<h1>8. Change History</h1>

<h2 id="0.16">Version 0.16 (2016-11-14)</h2>

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
  <img src="images/screenshot-login.png" style="width: 464px;"/>
</div>

<dl>
  <dt>Anonymous Users &amp; Login Dialogs</dt>
  <dd>
    The built-in <b>Start</b> and <b>Help</b> apps can now be used by
    anonymous users (non-logged-in users). Users can then login via the
    top-right menu and any restricted app will automatically display the
    new built-in login dialog if accessed without valid permissions.
  </dd>

  <dt>Refactored Access Control &amp; Permissions</dt>
  <dd>
    The role-based access controls have been refactored to support
    different types of access (read, search, internal, etc) and to be
    fully based on storage paths (instead of object types and names).
    All hard-coded refereces to the built-in <code>admin</code> role
    has also been removed, as the default configuration is now sufficient.
  </dd>

  <div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
    <img src="images/screenshot-apps.png" style="width: 252px;"/>
  </div>

  <dt>New Icons &amp; Refined Widgets</dt>
  <dd>
    FontAwesome icons are now available and used for many of the standard
    icons. This means better rendering in all sizes and in all resolutions.
    The Table, Progress and Popup widgets have also been restyled for a more
    modern look.
  </dd>

  <dt>Improved Documentation &amp; Help App</dt>
  <dd>
    The built-in <b>Help</b> app has been much improved, and the on-line
    documentation is now much clearer and up-to-date. The built-in
    <code>test</code> plug-in now provides an <b>Example</b> app that
    shows all widgets and icons available.
  </dd>

  <dt>Bug Fixes &amp; API Changes</dt>
  <dd>
    Lots of minor API changes have also been made and several JavaScript
    functions have been moved to the built-in <code>legacy</code> plug-in.
    Also, a number of bugs have been fixed to improve storage handling,
    session termination, connection management, etc.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2 id="0.15">Version 0.15 (2012-04-24)</h2>

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
  <img src="images/screenshot-password.png" />
</div>

<dl>
  <dt>Persistent Sessions</dt>
  <dd>
    User sessions are now stored to files on the server. These are kept
    for up to 30 days, meaning that users do not have to login as
    frequently as before (provided that their web browser cookies are
    intact).
  </dd>

  <dt>Password Changes &amp; Logouts</dt>
  <dd>
    A new password change dialog has been added to the
    <strong>User Menu</strong> at the top right corner. From there, it is
    easy to either change the password or logout.
  </dd>

  <div style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
    <img src="images/screenshot-start-window.png" />
  </div>

  <dt style="padding-top: 10px;">Launching Apps in Separate Windows</dt>
  <dd>
    Apps can now be launched in separate windows (or tabs) with their
    own URL. This means that apps can also be bookmarked.<br/><br/>
    This proves to be very convenient for immediate access to popular apps.
    Just press <strong>Ctrl</strong> or <strong>Alt</strong> when clicking
    the app launcher in the <strong>Start</strong> app.
  </dd>

  <div style="float: right; margin: 20px 0 10px 10px;">
    <img src="images/screenshot-cxn-details.png" />
  </div>

  <dt style="clear: left;">Editing Connection Settings</dt>
  <dd>
    Connections can now be created, edited and removed directly from the
    <strong>Admin</strong> app (in the new "Connections" tab).<br/><br/>
    The connection details view also provides information about current
    usage, pool size, timeout values, connection errors, JDBC driver
    and more.
  </dd>

  <dt>Storage &amp; Plug-In Information</dt>
  <dd>
    The <strong>Admin</strong> app has been improved to include direct
    links to the storage API for apps, connections and plug-ins. A new
    field also displays the source plug-in for apps, connections and
    procedures.
  </dd>

  <div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
      <img src="images/screenshot-widget.png" />
  </div>

  <dt>Updated Graphical Style</dt>
  <dd>
    The graphical style for many of the platform UI components (widgets)
    has been updated. This can be seen on dialogs, tabs, buttons, text
    input fields and more. The default icon set has also been extended
    with many new icons to use in apps.
  </dd>

  <dt>Plug-ins Stored in ZIP files</dt>
  <dd>
    Plug-ins are now stored unpacked on the server, i.e. the plug-in ZIP
    files are used directly. Any contained JAR file is moved to a temporary
    location when the plug-in is loaded and removed when it is unloaded.
  </dd>

  <dt>JDBC: Built-in Drivers for Drizzle, MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL</dt>
  <dd>
    JDBC drivers for Drizzle, MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL are now bundled and
    provided with the JDBC plug-in. Due to license restrictions, drivers
    for other popular databases cannot at this time be included with the
    default distribution.
  </dd>

  <dt>And Much More...</dt>
  <dd>
    This release also contains several programmer-visible changes.
    These include new API functions, bundled jQuery and other
    libraries, changes to the storage model, etc. See the API
    documentation for more details.
  </dd>
