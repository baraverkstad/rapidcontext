<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="overview">1.1. Overview</h2>

<p>RapidContext is a platform for building and hosting web applications. It
is ideal for creating and distributing web-based tools on an intranet and
provides a number of important advantages:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Simple Connectivity</strong> &mdash; Data access via
      <abbr title="Java Database Connectivity (for database access)">JDBC</abbr>,
      web services, messaging buses and more is built-in or readily available.
      This makes it easy to integrate with and connect to existing data sources
      and external systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Discovery</strong> &mdash; Using built-in components and
      tools, it is easy to create apps for exploring data across multiple
      systems. With an additional bit of knowledge of business rules and data
      models, unique tools for side-by-side comparisons, data analysis or
      drill-down search are quickly created.</li>
  <li><strong>Plug-In Architecture</strong> &mdash; The RapidContext platform
      is built on a plug-in architecture, allowing new connectors, services and
      applications to be deployed at run-time. New and updated plug-ins are
      available both from the RapidContext web site and from third
      parties.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrative Tools</strong> &mdash; An easy-to-use web app
      for managing users, connections and all other aspects of the system comes
      built-in with RapidContext. This makes it simple to manage and maintain
      multiple installations and/or complex configurations needed to fully
      serve corporate environments.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="setup">1.2. Standard Setup</h2>

<p>RapidContext provides a web application environment with both client (web
browser) and server components. The client and server parts are integrated,
providing easy-to-use solutions for all the common issues that arise in a web
environment (authentication, permissions, etc).</p>

<p>The web browser runs the web applications and manages the user interface.
In the standard setup, multiple applications are running on a single web page.
Data is fetched asynchronously in the background without blocking the user
from other parallel tasks.</p>

<p>The RapidContext server handles user authentication, sessions, permissions,
data connectivity, transactions, etc. The server runs the actual database
queries or remote sessions, while posting results back to the web applications
in a convenient <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> data
format.</p>

</p>


<h2 id="features">1.3. Features</h2>

<p>Using RapidContext for building web tools, connecting to databases or
managing servers has a number of advantages compared to other toolkits or
direct access via
<abbr title="Standard Query Language (for database queries)">SQL</abbr>,
<abbr title="Secure Shell (for terminal access)">SSH</abbr> or similar.</p>

<ol class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong> &mdash; All SQL queries and system
      commands used are stored on the RapidContext server for reuse and easy
      inspection. This improves knowledge sharing and information transfer
      between co-workers. It also helps with eliminating mistakes and data
      issues, since changes propagate immediately to all users.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource Footprint</strong> &mdash; Transactions and connection
      pooling is built-in and used whenever supported by the data source. This
      means that many users can efficiently share a small number of external
      connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Robust Security</strong> &mdash; User authentication,
      authorization and auditing mechanisms are available to guarantee
      the integrity of applications and data. Since users share connections,
      the direct access and number of accounts on external systems can also be
      reduced.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible Scripting</strong> &mdash; JavaScript is supported both
      on the client and the server side, providing a powerful programming
      environment for business logic, data transformations, validations or any
      kind of data handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient Workflows</strong> &mdash; A well-designed browsing
      user interface is at least an order of magnitude faster to work with than
      switching between multiple SQL and shell windows. Since computations are
      mostly performed in the client browsers, a single server can handle more
      users than a standard application server.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="concepts">1.4. Concepts &amp; Terminology</h2>

<p>A number of terms are used repeatedly in the RapidContext documentation and
elsewhere. Their definitions are as follows:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>App</strong> &mdash; A client-side application that runs in the
      web browser, normally in a tab in the standard user interface or as a
      stand-alone browser tab or window. Apps are installed on the server, but
      execute solely on the client. Multiple apps can be executing at the same
      time, allowing the user to switch between different tasks and
      transferring data between apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection</strong> &mdash; A named link to a database or
      another system. Each connection is managed on the server, normally by
      a handler for that specific connection type. Most connections are kept
      in a pool of established connections where they are continually
      monitored and closed if no longer needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Environment</strong> &mdash; A group of connections sharing an
      identifier prefix. Using different environments, it is possible to
      switch between servers easily. The environment name is also given
      prominent display in the standard user interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifier</strong> &mdash; A unique identity for an object
      in the RapidContext storage. The identifier should consist only of ASCII
      alphanumeric characters, preferably in lower-case. Hierarchical
      identifiers (containing <q>/</q> characters) are also possible, as for
      example <q><var>connection/jdbc</var></q> for the JDBC connection
      type.</li>
  <li><strong>Plug-in</strong> &mdash; A ZIP file containing Java libraries,
      procedures, apps, configuration or file data. A plug-in is the standard
      distribution mechanism for all kinds of add-on functionality in
      RapidContext.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedure</strong> &mdash; A server-side operation that can
      be invoked from the client. The operation may take arguments, modify
      data and/or return a value depending on implementation. A typical
      procedure could for example consist of a parameterized SQL query.</li>
  <li><strong>Role</strong> &mdash; A set of permissions (or limits) for
      resource usage and access. Each user is assigned one or more roles,
      providing the user with the sum of the role permissions. The default
      built-in role <q><var>admin</var></q> provides full access to everything,
      and should be used with care.</li>
  <li><strong>Session</strong> &mdash; An active client (browser) session to
      the RapidContext server. The session can be either authenticated (for a
      single user) or anonymous. Sessions are created when applications are
      launched and a user may have multiple active sessions in different web
      browsers.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage</strong> &mdash; A server-side virtual file system for
      storing data and objects. The storage handles both persistent (file) and
      temporary (in-memory) objects, allowing some objects to
      &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; others. All active plug-ins are mounted to the
      storage and overlaid on the root storage tree, providing a single
      unified storage view for all objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage Path</strong> &mdash; An object location in the
      RapidContext storage. The storage path is formed from the object type
      and identifier as <var>[type]/[identifier]</var>. Only the base type is
      used when searching for objects in the storage, i.e.
      <q><var>connection/</var></q> instead of
      <q><var>connection/jdbc/</var></q>.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong> &mdash; A server-side descriptor and optionally
      an associated Java handler for a piece of data in the RapidContext
      storage. The type contains meta-data and descriptions for all recognized
      properties of the type, similar to a Java class or an XML schema.</li>
  <li><strong>User</strong> &mdash; A login identity, usually assigned to a
      physical person. Each user has an identifier, a name, a description and
      a password. The user may also have one or more roles, which in turn
      control the user access permissions.</li>
</ul>
