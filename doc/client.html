<h1>Client Programming</h1>

<p>RapidContext client programming is based on JavaScript, HTML, CSS and
DOM (i.e. AJAX without XML). Client applications are called an "app" and
executes in the web browser. Care must therefore be taken to follow
appropriate web standards in order to remain compatible with all
targeted browsers.</p>


<h2>1. Technology Reference</h2>

<p>A number of web technologies are used in the standard RapidContext client
libraries, besides the RapidContext API:s themselves. Please refer to the

</ul>


<h2>2. App Declaration</h2>

<p>The app source code and resources are stored on the server, but will be
transferred to the client web browser upon launch. The client can also list
available apps through the built-in <code>System.App.List</code>
procedure. This procedure will return a list of all declared apps and
their respective configuration settings. If an app is not properly
declared in a configuration file, it will not be visible to the client
and the standard launch mechanisms won't work.</p>

<p>The app configuration file is normally placed in the
<code>plugin/local/app</code> directory (for the <code>local</code>
plug-in). The file name should match <code>&lt;app id&gt;.properties</code>,
replacing the unique app identifier for the <code>&lt;app id&gt;</code>
part. In the file, generic configuration parameters are specified along with
a list of URL resources required to load the app. Below follows a simple
example:</p>

<pre class="box code">
<span class="comment"># General properties</span>
name = Example App
description = A small example app.
className = ExampleApp

<span class="comment"># Resources array</span>
resources.0.url = example/app.js
resources.0.type = code
resources.1.url = example/icon.png
resources.1.type = icon
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the two files <code>icon.png</code> and
<code>app.js</code> are referenced and should be available in the plug-in
file area (more on that later). The app resources of type <code>code</code>
are dynamically loaded as JavaScript files into the web page when the app
is first launched and is thereafter reused without reloading on subsequent
launches. The available configuration parameters and their meaning is as
follows:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>name</code> &mdash; The app name as presented to the user.
      This name is shown in various places in the default user interface.</li>
  <li><code>description</code> &mdash; The optional app description that
      may be presented to the user.</li>
  <li><code>className</code> &mdash; The app JavaScript class name. This
      name must be unique and refer to a constructor function for the app
      instance (see below for more details). The class name must be unique
      in order to avoid collisions with other apps being executed in the
      same web page. The source code for the class should be placed in one
      of the <code>code</code> resources listed.</li>
  <li><code>launch</code> &mdash; The optional app launch setting. Can have
      one of the following values:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>manual</code> (default) &mdash; The app is manually started
        and stopped by the user (when clicking on icons or similar).</li>
    <li><code>auto</code> &mdash; The app is started automatically when
        a new user session starts, but can also be started and stopped
        manually by the user.</li>
    <li><code>once</code> &mdash; The app is started automatically when
        a new user session starts and can thereafter neither be started nor
        stopped by the user.</li>
    <li><code>limited</code> &mdash; The app is hidden from the user to
        avoid manual starting and stopping in the default user interface.
        The app can still be started programmatically by other apps
        through the RapidContext client API:s.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><code>resources.#.url</code> &mdash; The resource local URL. The actual
      resource data must also be mapped onto this URL, which is normally
      achieved by placing it in the <code>plugin/local/files</code> directory
      (for the <code>local</code> plug-in). It is a good custom to prefix all
      URL:s in order to avoid collisions with URL:s from other plug-ins.</li>
  <li><code>resources.#.type</code> &mdash; The resource type. Can be any
      text string, but the following values have a defined meaning:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>code</code> &mdash; A JavaScript source code file that must be
        loaded before app launch.</li>
    <li><code>style</code> &mdash; A CSS stylesheet file that must be loaded
        before app launch.</li>
    <li><code>ui</code> &mdash; A user interface XML definition file (see
        below). The interface specified in this file will be automatically
        created each time the app is launched.</li>
    <li><code>icon</code> &mdash; An app icon displayed in the default
        user interface for launching the app. Should be a transparent
        GIF or PNG image in 48x48 size for optimal viewing.</li>
    <li><code>file</code> &mdash; A generic file resource with no special
        handling.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><code>resource.#.id</code> &mdash; The optional resource identifier. All
      resources with an identifier are easily accessible from the app
      JavaScript code, using a <code>this.resource.&lt;id&gt;</code> construct.
      This is useful for providing URL:s to icons, images or files used by
      the app.</li>
  <li><code>resources.#.topic</code> &mdash; The optional resource help topic
      name. Use only if the resource file contains a HTML help document for
      the app. The topic name may contain <code>/</code> characters to
      indicate directories.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. App Implementation</h2>

<p>All apps are implemented as JavaScript objects with a common constructor
function (i.e. as JavaScript "classes"). Upon launch, the app
constructor function is called and a new app instance object is supposed
to be created. In the default user interface it is possible to launch multiple
instances of a single app, so usage of global variables or similar should
be avoided in app implementations.</p>

<p>Normally a single <code>code</code> resource contains the source code file
for the app. By declaring multiple <code>code</code> resources, several
source code files can be loaded to provide helper functions, configuration
code, etc.</p>

<p>The JavaScript constructor function for an app must be named
<strong>exactly</strong> as specified by the <code>className</code> property
in the <code>&lt;app id&gt;.properties</code> file. The created objects
must also contain two methods &mdash; <code>start()</code> and
<code>stop()</code> &mdash; that handles the app lifecycle. Below is an
example JavaScript file that implements a minimal example app:</p>

<pre class="box code">
<span class="comment">/**
 * Creates a new ExampleApp instance. This function is called once all
 * app JavaScript resources have been loaded. It is called as a
 * constructor function, so it will create a new object with the prototype
 * inherited from the function.
 */</span>
function ExampleApp() {
<span class="comment">    // Constructor code. No user interface or external calls here.</span>
}

<span class="comment">/**
 * Starts the app execution. This function is called when the user
 * interface has been created (if available).
 */</span>
ExampleApp.prototype.start = function() {
<span class="comment">    // this.className -- the app className property value
    // this.ui -- a map of identifiers from the user interface XML
    // this.ui.root -- the user interface parent container widget
    // this.ui.overlay -- the default overlay widget for the app
    // this.resource -- a map of resource URL:s</span>
}

<span class="comment">/**
 * Stops the app execution. This function is called when the user
 * has terminated the app, but before the user interface is
 * destroyed. The app should kill any asynchronous requests
 * currently executing when this method is called.
 */</span>
ExampleApp.prototype.stop = function() {
<span class="comment">    // stop async requests and other pending actions</span>
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>RapidContext.App.startApp()</code> function is responsible for
app loading, instance creation and calling the <code>start()</code> method
once the user interface has been created. A number of instance variables will
also be provided to all app instances:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>this.className</code> &mdash; The app class name value.</li>
  <li><code>this.ui</code> &mdash; Contains an <code>Object</code> with
      properties for any user interface widget with an <code>id</code>
      attribute. The property value is set to the UI widget or DOM node.</li>
  <li><code>this.ui.root</code> &mdash; Contains the parent container widget
      for the app user interface, normally an instance of
      <code>RapidContext.Widget.Pane</code>.</li>
  <li><code>this.ui.overlay</code> &mdash; Contains a
      <code>RapidContext.Widget.Overlay</code> widget for the whole app user
      interface. This overlay is used while loading the app resources,
      but may thereafter be used by the app to display various messages
      while blocking the user interface for input.</li>
  <li><code>this.resource</code> &mdash; Contains an <code>Object</code>
      with properties for any app resource with an <code>id</code>
      attribute in the <code>.app</code> file. The value is a string with
      the resource URL.</li>
</ul>


<h2>4. User Interface XML</h2>

<p>The user interface for an app is normally contained inside a
<code>RapidContext.Widget.TabContainer</code> widget. The app itself is
assigned a <code>RapidContext.Widget.Pane</code> widget inside which it is
responsible for creating and managing its own user interface.</p>

<p>The RapidContext platform further simplifies the user interface creation
however, by providing an optional mechanism for automatically creating the
user interface from a serialized XML format. The user interface XML is
normally stored in a <code>ui.xml</code> file in the same location as the
app JavaScript source code and other resources. To trigger the automatic
loading and creation of the user interface from this file, it must be
specified as an app resource as follows:</p>

<pre class="box code">
...
resources.2.url = example/ui.xml
resources.2.type = ui
</pre>

<p>The <code>ui.xml</code> file contains a mix of plain XHTML and an XML
serialization of user interface widgets defined in the
<code>RapidContext.Widget</code> namespace. The actual XML is processed by
the <code>RapidContext.UI.buildUI</code> function. Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre class="box code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;ui&gt;
  &lt;Button id="test"&gt;&lt;Icon ref="COMMENT" /&gt; Press Me&lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/ui&gt;
</pre>

<p>The root XML tag in a <code>ui.xml</code> file should always be
<code>&lt;ui&gt;</code>. Inside this tag, all well-formed XML tags will be
interpreted as follows:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong>Tag Names</strong> &mdash; The XML tag names will be looked up
      in the <code>RapidContext.Widget.CLASSES</code> map, using the exact
      case-sensitive tag name. If found, the corresponding constructor function
      is used to create the HTML DOM node. Otherwise the tag name is sent to
      the <code>MochiKit.DOM.createDOM</code> function to create the
      corresponding HTML DOM node.</li>
  <li><strong>The <code>id</code> Attribute</strong> &mdash; The <code>id</code>
      attribute is not set on the HTML DOM node created. Instead it is used
      to map the DOM node in the returned app <code>this.ui</code> lookup
      object. The benefit of this solution is that any identified DOM nodes
      are immediately available, without going through the DOM API of
      <code>document.getElementById</code>. Also, this solution avoids
      identifier collisions when the same app is launched twice or when
      multiple apps use the same identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>The <code>class</code> Attribute</strong> &mdash;
      The <code>class</code> attribute value is set on the HTML DOM node
      created (similar to in HTML files). Note that widgets will have more
      CSS classes than the ones specified, potentially causing conflicts
      with specific style settings (see below).</li>
  <li><strong>The <code>w</code>, <code>h</code> &amp; <code>a</code>
      Attributes</strong>&mdash; The attributes <code>w</code>,
      <code>h</code> and <code>a</code> are not set on the HTML DOM node
      created, but are instead used in a call to
      <code>RapidContext.Util.registerSizeConstraints</code>. This sets up a
      JavaScript function for the node that will calculate the appropriate
      size and aspect ratio whenever <code>RapidContext.Util.resizeElements</code>
      is called (mostly done automatically by the platform).</li>
  <li><strong>Other Attributes</strong> &mdash; Other XML attributes are
      either set as string values to the HTML DOM nodes created, or sent to
      the corresponding <code>RapidContext.Widget.setAttrs</code> function. This
      makes it possible to configure each widget with the specific attributes
      supported in each case.</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. User Interface Style</h2>

<p>The platform user interface is default styled by two CSS files &mdash;
<code>css/style.css</code> and <code>css/widget.css</code>. When the default
style is not sufficient, the element style can be set either inline on the
specific elements or by loading an additional CSS file. Only in special
circumstances should the default CSS files be overwritten or modified, since
such changes won't be preserved in platform updates. Below follows a list
of the possibilities for user interface styling:</p>

<ol class="box">
  <li><strong>Element <code>style</code> Attribute</strong> &mdash; The
      easiest way to modify the style of a widget or an HTML DOM node is by
      setting the <code>style</code> attribute. This can be done either in
      the <code>ui.xml</code> file or through the
      <code>MochiKit.Style.setStyle</code> function.</li>
  <li><strong>Loading Additional CSS files</strong> &mdash; Another way to
      style the user interface is by loading additional an additional CSS
      file. Ideally such a file should not modify styles for all elements,
      but only those with specific <code>class</code> names. Otherwise,
      apps or widgets might break in various ways. To override specific
      default styles, the normal CSS cascading and priority order can also
      be used (although this is not recommended).</li>
  <li><strong>Replace Default CSS Files</strong> &mdash; The default CSS files
      are located in the system plug-in and can be replaced in any other
      plug-in. The same is true for the default image and icon set located
      in the <code>images</code> directory. Replacing default styles or
      images is useful for creating a new user interface theme for the whole
      platform, but it is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> to replace or
      modify these files for other purposes. The styles and images provided
      by these files might change without notice in future versions.</li>
</ol>
