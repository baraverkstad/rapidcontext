<h1>Server Programming</h1>

<p>RapidContext server programming is based on Java, JavaScript and the specific
languages used for communication with external systems (such as SQL). Server
functionality is added by <em>plug-ins</em>, a ZIP file containing Java
libraries, procedures, apps, configuration or file data. The API:s exposed
by the server to the client is file retrieval (HTTP GET), file upload (HTTP
POST to a specific URL) and a set of callable <em>procedures</em>.</p>


<h2>1. Plug-in Installation &amp; Restarts</h2>

<p>Plug-ins are installed or updated by using the built-in Admin app.
The steps below explains how to install or update a plug-in:</p>

<ol class="box">
  <li>Choose the "Plug-Ins" tab in the Admin app</li>
  <li>Locate the "Software Install &amp; Update" pane at the top (see
      screenshot)</li>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="screenshot-plugin-upload.png" />
  </p>
  <li>Click the "Browse..." button and choose the plug-in ZIP file</li>
  <li>Wait for the upload progress bar to complete</li>
  <li>Click the "Install / Update Plug-In" button</li>
  <li>The plug-in has been installed (but client and/or server restarts
      might be necessary)</li>
</ol>

<p>Plug-ins can also easily be loaded and unloaded through the built-in
Admin app. Once unloaded, the plug-in directory under
<code>plugin</code> can be removed to completely uninstall it. In certain
circumstances, the web browser and/or the server must also be restarted
for the plug-in loading or unloading to have effect:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong>Client Restarts:</strong> Once a new plug-in has been
      installed, it is normally possible to use any apps in it
      immediately. The list of displayed apps on the start page is not
      automatically updated, however. So sometimes a restart of the web
      browser (using Ctrl-R for a forced page reload) might be necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Server Restarts:</strong> The server is automatically
      re-initiated once a plug-in has been installed, loaded or unloaded.
      This is however not always sufficient when the plug-in contains Java
      libraries that conflicts with ones previously loaded in the Java
      Virtual Machine. This happens, for example, when updating a plug-in
      containing a modified JAR file, in which case the server must be
      restarted manually.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. Plug-in Structure</h2>

<p>All installed plug-ins are stored unpacked in the <code>plugin</code>
directory. Each plug-in is stored in its own subdirectory based on the
unique plug-in identifier. A few plug-in identifiers are reserved with a
special meaning:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>system</code> &mdash; A plug-in that provides all the platform
      built-in functionality. In essence, a platform update consists of
      replacing this plug-in with a new version. This plug-in is always
      searched last, meaning that any file in it may be fully replaced by
      an equally named file in another plug-in.</li>
  <li><code>local</code> &mdash; A plug-in the provides all the local
      modifications to the default platform settings. In particular this
      plug-in usually stores the <code>config.properties</code> file that
      lists which plug-ins should be loaded on startup. This plug-in is
      always searched first, meaning that any file in it will always
      override an equally named file in another plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>When installing a plug-in, the contents of the ZIP file is just unpacked
into the corresponding <code>plugin/&lt;plug-in id&gt;</code> directory.
The plug-in directories and their corresponding ZIP files are all structured
in the same way. The list below explains the standard files and directories:</p>

<pre class="box code">
plugin.properties <span class="comment">-- The plug-in manifest file (see below)</span>
files/            <span class="comment">-- Contains all files mapped to URL:s</span>
lib/              <span class="comment">-- Contains Java JAR libraries to load</span>
app/              <span class="comment">-- Contains app configuration files</span>
procedure/        <span class="comment">-- Contains procedure configuration files</span>
environment/      <span class="comment">-- Contains environment configuration file(s)</span>
role/             <span class="comment">-- Contains role configuration files</span>
user/             <span class="comment">-- Contains user configuration files</span>
</pre>

<p>The <code>files</code> sub-directory is special in that it automatically
maps the files inside onto URL:s. This is the standard way to provide
JavaScript source files, images and other resources needed by the apps
running in the web browser.</p>


<h2>3. Plug-in Development</h2>

<p>Each plug-in must contain a <code>plugin.properties</code> manifest file.
It is the only mandatory content of a plug-in and consists of the following
fields:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>id</code> &mdash; The unique plug-in identifier. May only contain
      ASCII alphanumeric characters without spaces or separators.</li>
  <li><code>name</code> &mdash; The plug-in name as presented to the users.</li>
  <li><code>version</code> &mdash; The plug-in version number.</li>
  <li><code>description</code> &mdash; The optional description text that
      explains what functionality in provided by the plug-in.</li>
  <li><code>className</code> &mdash; The optional fully qualified name of
      a Java class that is loaded to initialize the plug-in. The class must
      subclass <code>org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.Plugin</code> and handled the
      lifecycle of the plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plug-in manifest is the first file to write when developing a plug-in.
An example <code>plugin.properties</code> file is illustrated below:</p>

<pre class="box code">
<span class="comment"># General properties</span>
id = example
name = Example Plug-in
version = 1.0
description = Provides tests and examples for the platform.
className = org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.example.ExamplePlugin
</pre>

<p>Once the <code>plugin.properties</code> file has been created, the template
<code>src/plugin/build.xml</code> file can be copied into the root of the
plug-in development folder. With this Ant build file, it is easy to package
the plug-in ZIP file for installation.</p>


<h2>4. Procedures</h2>

<p>Most common server-side operations can be achieved by creating one or
more <em>procedures</em>. A procedure is a server-side operation that can be
invoked from the client or from other procedures. The operation may take
arguments, modify data and/or return a value depending on implementation.</p>

<p>Each procedure has a specific procedure type. The procedure type
defines which server-side Java code is used to execute the procedure. Since
most server-side operations are so similar, only a few different procedure
types are actually needed. So most procedures are instead created by
configuring one of the standard procedure types available. The standard
procedure types are listed below:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>built-in</code> &mdash; The built-in procedure type, used for
      non-configurable procedures implemented directly in Java code. This
      procedure type is normally only used for platform operations.</li>
  <li><code>cmdline.exec</code> &mdash; The command-line execution procedure
      type, used for running shell commands on the server. Procedure arguments
      may be inserted as arguments on the command-line.</li>
  <li><code>http.post</code> &mdash; The HTTP POST request procedure type,
      used for sending dynamic data to a receiving URL. Procedure arguments
      may be inserted into the request headers and/or data.</li>
  <li><code>javascript</code> &mdash; The JavaScript procedure type, used
      for fully dynamic control of the execution. Procedure arguments may
      be provided as global variables for the JavaScript code upon
      execution.</li>
  <li><code>jdbc.query</code> &mdash; The JDBC SQL query procedure type,
      used for SQL SELECT queries returning results. Procedure arguments
      may be inserted as literals into the SQL text.</li>
  <li><code>jdbc.statement</code> &mdash; The JDBC SQL statement procedure
      type, used for SQL INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements (and others).
      Procedure arguments may be inserted as literals into the SQL text.</li>
</ul>

<p>By installing additional plug-ins, more procedure types can become
available. It is possible to edit or create new procedures of any registered
procedure type in the Admin app. Below is a screenshot showing the location
of the add and edit procedure buttons:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="screenshot-procedure-buttons.png" />
</p>

<p>By storing SQL queries, JavaScript code or similar as configuration
parameters, it is possible to create advanced procedures easily without
writing any Java code at all. Each procedure configuration parameter has
a specific type, as listed below:</p>

<ol class="box">
  <li><strong>Constant Data</strong> &mdash; The value is a data string that
      may or may not span multiple lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedure Reference</strong> &mdash; The value contains a
      procedure name. The procedure can be called by using the identifier
      as a function (JavaScript only).</li>
  <li><strong>Connection Reference</strong> &mdash; The value contains a
      connection name. The connection will be reserved before calling the
      procedure and the identifier allows calling any connection methods
      directly from JavaScript.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedure Argument</strong> &mdash; The value is the
      description of a procedure argument, as shown to the user. When the
      procedure is executing, the identifier will be replaced by the value
      provided by the procedure caller.</li>
</ol>

<p>Editing the procedure and the procedure configuration parameters is
easy in the Admin app, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="screenshot-procedure-edit.png" />
</p>

<p>Once created or modified, the procedures edited in the Admin app are
stored in the <code>local</code> plug-in, in the <code>procedures</code>
directory. From that location the files may be copied into the corresponding
plug-in development folder for procedures.</p>


<h2>5. Environment</h2>

<p>The environment contains a list of named connections. Each connection
name is associated with a set of parameters for creating new connnections.
The creation parameters depend what each adapter requires and may contain
IP addresses, user names, passwords and similar. There is currently no
user interface for editing or creating environment files, so they must
be manually created as <code>environment/&lt;name&gt;.properties</code> in
one of the plug-ins. See below for a simple example environment file.</p>

<pre class="box code">
<span class="comment"># Environment information</span>
name = EXAMPLE
description = The example environment

<span class="comment"># Pool 0 configuration</span>
pool.0.name = jdbc.example
pool.0.adapter = jdbc
pool.0.param.maxConnections = 10
pool.0.param.maxIdleSecs = 600
pool.0.param.driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
pool.0.param.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/example_database
pool.0.param.user = example
pool.0.param.password = password
pool.0.param.sqlping = SHOW DATABASES
pool.0.param.timeout = 45

<span class="comment"># Pool 1 configuration</span>
pool.1.name = http.ncbi.entrez
pool.1.adapter = http
pool.1.param.maxConnections = 0
pool.1.param.url = http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
</pre>

<p>The environment also keeps a pool of established connections. The
connection pools are used to minimize the overhead of creating and closing
connections, as well as providing a mechanism to limit the resource usage
in the server. Connections are created or reserved automatically before
processing user requests. This enables detection of resource shortages before
any actual operations are made. All connections reserved also participate in
the same transaction (if supported) and will be committed or rolled back
in sequence.</p>

<p class="box"><strong>Note:</strong> A RapidContext server may only have a
single environment loaded. This environment (and all its connections) is
shared between all apps, procedures and users on the server. If several
environment are required, separate RapidContext server instances must be
used.</p>
