<h1>6. Development Guidelines</h1>

<h2 id="usage">6.1. Design Principle Usage</h2>

<p>This chapter lists of some of the key principles guiding the design of
RapidContext. It is an attempt to explain some of the trade-offs, omissions and
choices made for the platform.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Read this document as the RapidContext declaration of <q>good
        taste</q>, whatever that means. And consider the <q>pattern</q>
        examples as templates.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        Do not read this as a set of absolute principles that can never be
        broken. The <q>anti-pattern</q> examples show that they already have
        been.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="less_is_more">6.2. Less is More</h2>

<p>The less code that is written, the less code needs to be maintained,
corrected and refactored. By omitting difficult, poorly designed or rarely used
features, time and focus can be shifted to more pressing needs.</p>

<p>Also, by not including poorly designed API:s in the product, it is possible
to revisit the omitted feature at a later date. Hopefully with a better
understanding, more realistic use cases and/or a better design proposal.</p>

<p>This principle is sometimes referred to as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        The built-in transaction support is limited to the most commonly used
        scenario. Code and work-arounds are required for other behaviors.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        Built-in support for SVG, PlotKit diagrams, procedure call interceptors
        and more...
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="declarative">6.3. Declarative over Imperative</h2>

<p>Using a declarative language over an imperative one has a number of
advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The source code becomes less verbose and easier to read</li>
  <li>The data might be reused for other purposes</li>
  <li>The data might become readable by non-developers</li>
</ol>

<p>These advantages are especially valid for configuration parameters, data
transformations or similar.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        The user interface XML (<var>ui.xml</var>) format is less verbose and
        easier to read than JavaScript code (imperative) for the same thing.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        Custom widgets are still not possible to create using XML, but require
        everything to be done in JavaScript code.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="simplicity">6.4. Simplicity over Documentation</h2>

<p>An application that is simple or easy to use doesn't require much (if any)
documentation. Using tooltips or small in-app help texts in the user interface,
reduces the need for user guide or screenshot sequences.</p>

<p>Note that simplification of the user interface is not identical to reducing
the number of feature or making development easier. On the contrary, simplicity
often requires much hard work with auto-detection, generalization and various
smart tricks in the interface. Generally, only the <strong>illusion of
simplicity</strong> is desired.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        The automatic detection of <var>java</var> location and available port
        number when launching the RapidContext server.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        Creating new apps and plug-ins still can't be done without access to
        the manual or by copying from other apps or plug-ins.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="defaults">6.5. Defaults over Configuration</h2>

<p>Sensible default values should be used instead of forcing users to configure
the application. When in doubt, use defaults suitable for the majority or for
the least technically inclined.</p>

<p>This principle is also applicable when designing API:s, where common use
cases should be made as simple as possible. This is sometimes referred to as
<strong>optimizing for the common case</strong>.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        The default <var>admin</var> user is created with a blank password when
        no other users are configured.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        The app and plug-in configurations are mostly identical and should be
        possible to omit, using heuristics to set the defaults.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="implementation">6.6. Implementation over Specification</h2>

<p>Most concepts and features are better understood after creating a working
implementation with real-world data, rather than by writing a specification.
<strong>Working code is preferred over ideas</strong>.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be confused with the good practice of providing example data
and interactions (use cases) before starting the implementation.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Implement new ideas or behaviors as plug-ins. If they prove useful, the
        core extensions may be suitable for inclusion in the platform.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td class="unimportant">
        No current example found
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="dynamic_types">6.7. Dynamic over Strict Types</h2>

<p>This issue has been debated at length elsewhere. Suffice to say here that
dynamic types is a core feature in JavaScript (and many other
productivity-improving languages), so it makes sense to try to take this into
account when building Java code for RapidContext.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Pattern</th>
      <th></th>
      <th style="width: 48%;">Anti-Pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        The generic <var>Dict</var> and <var>Array</var> classes add some
        generic duck-typing to Java. They also simplify serializing to JSON,
        HTML or <var>.properties</var> files.
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        The Java implementation of built-in procedures or procedure types still
        require a number of specific interfaces and classes that are rather
        strict.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
