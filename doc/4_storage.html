<h1>4. Plug-Ins &amp; Storage</h1>

<h2 id="plugins">4.1 Plug-ins &amp; Server Files</h2>

<p>All RapidContext server functionality is provided by plug-ins. The plug-in
files are stored in the <var>plugin/</var> directory on the server. The
figure below illustrates the directory structure:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li>
    <var>plugin/</var>
    <ul>
      <li><var>cmdline.plugin</var> &mdash; The command-line plug-in</li>
      <li><var>http.plugin</var> &mdash; The HTTP plug-in</li>
      <li><var>jdbc.plugin</var> &mdash; The JDBC plug-in</li>
      <li>
        <var>local/</var> &mdash; A plug-in with local modifications and additions
        <ul>
          <li><var>connection/</var> &mdash; Connections added or modified</li>
          <li><var>lib/</var> &mdash; JAR files added (JDBC drivers)</li>
          <li><var>role/</var> &mdash; Roles added or modified</li>
          <li><var>session/</var> &mdash; Currently active sessions</li>
          <li><var>user/</var> &mdash; Users added or modified</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><var>system.plugin</var> &mdash; The system or core platform plug-in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As seen above, most plug-ins are stored as <var>.plugin</var> files (ZIP
archives) in the <var>plugin/</var> directory. Only the <var>local</var>
plug-in is stored in unpacked form by default. There are two special plug-ins
that cannot be removed or unloaded:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>system</var> &mdash; A plug-in that provides all the platform
      built-in functionality. In essence, a platform update consists of
      replacing this plug-in with a new version. This plug-in is always
      searched last, meaning that any file in it may be &ldquo;shadowed&rdquo;
      by a file with the same name from another plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>local</var> &mdash; A plug-in that provides the local modifications
      and additions to RapidContext. It is the only read-write plug-in (all
      others are read-only) and is stored unpacked to enable direct
      modification to the files. This plug-in is always searched first, meaning
      that any file in it will always &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; a file with the same
      name in another plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of plug-ins to load on startup is stored in the
<var>config.properties</var> file (in the <var>plugin/local/</var> directory).
The plug-in order in that file also controls the order in which plug-ins are
loaded.</p>


<h2 id="storage">4.2 Storage Overview</h2>

<p>The plug-ins are managed by the RapidContext <strong>storage</strong>
subsystem. The server storage provides a unified view of all objects in the
system, similar to a virtual file system. It has a number of important
features:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Object Identification</strong> &mdash; All objects can be located
      and fetched using a unique object identifier, similar to an absolute file
      name.</li>
  <li><strong>Browsing &amp; Lookup</strong> &mdash; The hierarchical structure
      of the storage makes it possible to browse and provide a RESTful view
      of its content. Any intermediate directory levels are automatically
      created when objects are stored (and removed if deleted).</li>
  <li><strong>Meta-data &amp; Introspection</strong> &mdash; A basic level of
      object meta-data is provided for all objects. This makes it possible to
      introspect and control many aspects of the running system.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence &amp; Serialization</strong> &mdash; Standard object
      serialization automatically handles Java object creation and destruction,
      as well as persistence to disk. Storage objects can be serialized in four
      different formats:
      <ul>
        <li><var>.properties</var> &mdash; Java properties file format. Simple
            key-value pairs, easy to read and edit manually.</li>
        <li><var>.yaml</var> &mdash; YAML format. Improves upon properties
            format with simpler syntax for nested structures (objects and
            arrays).</li>
        <li><var>.json</var> &mdash; JSON format. Standard web format, good for
            programmatic access and interoperability with tools and systems.</li>
        <li><var>.xml</var> &mdash; XML format. Structured markup format, useful
            for complex nested data and interoperability with XSLT or
            external XML-based systems.</li>
      </ul>
      All formats are equivalent in functionality; choose based on readability
      and tooling preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Cache</strong> &mdash; Live objects are cached in memory
      as long as the objects require. Background serialization to disk for
      modified objects is also provided.</li>
  <li><strong>Virtual Objects</strong> &mdash; The storage system also manages
      virtual objects that are only in server memory with no persistent
      representation. This allows easy introspection into some aspects of the
      running system.</li>
  <li><strong>Permissions &amp; Access Control</strong> &mdash; A role-based
      access control system handles user permissions for <var>search</var>,
      <var>read</var> and <var>write</var> operations.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="storage_tree">4.3 Storage Tree</h2>

<p>The storage tree can be browsed and inspected directly (requires
<strong>admin</strong> role) from the <var>rapidcontext/storage/</var> path on
the server. The directory tree is structured into directories based on the
object types, as seen below:</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><var>.storage/</var></td>
        <td>Mount-points for storage providers (plug-ins, etc)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>app/</var></td>
        <td>App configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>connection/</var></td>
        <td>Connection configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>environment/</var></td>
        <td>Environment configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>files/</var></td>
        <td>Contains files to serve via HTTP (maps directly to URL:s)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>lib/</var></td>
        <td>Java JAR libraries to load (server-side)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>plugin/</var></td>
        <td>Currently loaded plug-ins</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>procedure/</var></td>
        <td>Procedure configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>role/</var></td>
        <td>Role configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>session/</var></td>
        <td>Currently active sessions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>type/</var></td>
        <td>Storage type configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>vault/</var></td>
        <td>External value vault configurations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>user/</var></td>
        <td>User configuration files</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>All plug-ins are mounted to the storage tree, under the <var>storage/</var>
directory. Active (loaded) plug-ins are also overlaid onto the root storage
tree. Each plug-in therefore shares some parts of the overall directory layout
(outlined above). The plug-in storages may also &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; objects
in the tree from other plug-ins, which is used when modifying objects.</p>

<p>The built-in storage mount points are structured as shown in the figure
below:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>storage/</var> &mdash; Mount-points for all storage providers
    <ul>
      <li><var>cache/</var> &mdash; Storage caches for mounted overlay storages
        <ul>
          <li><var>plugin/</var> &mdash; Storage caches for plug-in storages</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><var>plugin/</var> &mdash; Mount-points for plug-in storage providers
        <ul>
          <li><var>cmdline/</var> &mdash; Mount-point for the <var>cmdline</var> plug-in</li>
          <li><var>http/</var> &mdash; Mount-point for the <var>http</var> plug-in</li>
          <li><var>jdbc/</var> &mdash; Mount-point for the <var>jdbc</var> plug-in</li>
          <li><var>local/</var> &mdash; Mount-point for the <var>local</var> plug-in</li>
          <li><var>system/</var> &mdash; Mount-point for the <var>system</var> plug-in</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="storage_type">4.4 Storage Data Types</h2>

<p>The objects retrieved from storage all have a storage data type. The data
types can be divided into three categories that cover everything:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Index</strong> &mdash; An object that provides a directory
      listing of the current storage path. The index objects are automatically
      generated from the storage content and cannot be modified directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Object</strong> &mdash; A set of key-value pairs that can be
      inspected and serialized to a number of formats (JSON, XML, etc). An
      object may contain nested data structures consisting of arrays or
      objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Binary</strong> &mdash; An opaque object that is only available
      as a binary data stream. This is used for serving static images, HTML
      files and similar. The object MIME type is based on the file extension,
      i.e. the characters after the first <q>.</q> in the storage path.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two categories of objects expose their storage data type in the
<var>type</var> property, e.g. <q><var>connection/jdbc</var></q> for a JDBC
connection object. The data types themselves are also objects that can be
retrieved from the <var>type/[type identifier]</var> storage path. The example
below shows parts of the JDBC connection data type (in YAML format):</p>

<pre class="box blue pb-3"><code>id: connection/jdbc
type: type
description: &gt;-
    The JDBC connection type. JDBC connections allows execution of SQL queries
    and statements to any JDBC data source. Connections may be pooled for
    maximum resource utilization.
initializer: org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.jdbc.JdbcConnection
property:
  - name: url
    description: |-
        The JDBC connection URL. (...)
    required: true
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>The object type <var>initializer</var> property links a data object to a
Java object. Whenever such an object is retrieved from storage, the
corresponding Java object will be automatically created and put into the
storage cache. The Java objects in the storage cache may remain there
indefinitely, but roughly every 30 seconds a cache cleanup job will destroy any
objects reporting an inactive status.</p>


<h2 id="hidden_props">4.5 Hidden &amp; Computed Properties</h2>

<p>Sensitive data such as passwords or access tokens can be stored in a
<strong>hidden property</strong> which is prefixed by a <q><var>.</var></q>
character. Such properties are filtered out whenever an object is returned via
a procedure or similar. They remain available for Java implementations of
connections, procedures, etc.</p>

<p>The example below shows how the <var>password</var> property is hidden for
<var>user</var> objects by default:</p>

<pre class="box blue pb-3"><code>id: johndoe
type: user
name: John Doe
description: A simple example user
enabled: true
realm: RapidContext
.password: secret
</code></pre>

<p>Some properties are calculated or transient and should not be written to
storage. These <strong>computed properties</strong> are prefixed by a
<q><var>_</var></q> character. Any operation that writes to storage will
filter these out.</p>


<h2 id="expansion">4.6 Value Expansion, Vaults &amp; Secrets</h2>

<p>Secrets or external property values can be auto-expanded when loaded from
storage. Value expansion uses a <q><var>${{secret-key}}</var></q> syntax, and
is supported for all serialization formats (properties, json, yaml, xml).</p>

<p>The value lookup for the expansion keys are handled via one or more of the
configured vaults. By default, the <var>env</var> and <var>prop</var> vaults
are available (for looking up values via system environment variables or Java
system properties). When expanding variables, a specific vault can be specified
instead of a global lookup; e.g. <q><var>${{env!SECRET_TOKEN}}</var></q>.</p>

<p>Default values for missing keys can be specified after the key, e.g.
<q><var>${{prop!key:default}}</var></q>. If no default is specified, any missing
reference will be expanded to an empty string.</p>

<p>Here are some additional examples of value expansion:</p>

<pre class="box blue pb-3"><code><span class="comment"># Using environment variable with default</span>
url = ${{env!DATABASE_URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost/test}}

<span class="comment"># Using Java system property</span>
timeout = ${{prop!app.timeout:30}}

<span class="comment"># Multiple expansions in one value</span>
connectionString = ${{env!DB_HOST}}:${{env!DB_PORT}}/${{env!DB_NAME}}
</code></pre>

<div class="box red flex-row">
  <i class="box-icon fa fa-minus-circle"></i>
  <div>
    <h2 class="m-0">Security Notice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unlimited Expansion</strong> &mdash; Property expansion is
          unlimited, meaning that references will be expanded for any storable
          object in the tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Read-Write Asymmetry</strong> &mdash; Any user with write
          access to storage objects can save data with property expansion
          references. When reading the data back, the value references are
          expanded.</li>
      <li><strong>Secret Extraction</strong> &mdash; Users with object
          write access can thus extract secrets by referencing their keys
          when storing data. A special block for this is implemented for
          user settings.</li>
    </ul>
