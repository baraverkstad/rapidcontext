<h1>5. Server &amp; Plug-In Development</h1>

<h2 id="plugin_struct">5.1. Plug-in Structure</h2>

<p>All RapidContext server functionality is provided by plug-ins. The plug-ins
are distributed as ZIP files named
<var>[plugin identifier]-[version].plugin</var>, and can contain Java
libraries, procedures, apps, connections, roles or any other object from the
RapidContext storage.  A few plug-ins are reserved with a special meaning:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>system</var> &mdash; A plug-in that provides all the platform
      built-in functionality. In essence, a platform update consists of
      replacing this plug-in with a new version. This plug-in is always
      searched last, meaning that any file in it may be shadowed by a file
      with the same name from another plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>local</var> &mdash; A plug-in that provides all local modifications
      and additions to RapidContext storage. In particular this plug-in usually
      stores the <var>config.properties</var> file that lists which plug-ins
      to load on startup. This plug-in is always searched first, meaning that
      any file in it will always shadow a file with the same name in another
      plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>All installed plug-ins are stored in the <var>plugin</var> directory on the
RapidContext server. Most plug-in are stored in their original ZIP files, which
can contain an internal directory structure like this:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
      <td><var>app/</var></td>
      <td>App configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>connection/</var></td>
      <td>Connection configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>environment/</var></td>
      <td>Environment configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>files/</var></td>
      <td>Contains files to serve via HTTP (maps directly to URL:s)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>lib/</var></td>
      <td>Java JAR libraries to load (server-side)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>procedure/</var></td>
      <td>Procedure configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>role/</var></td>
      <td>Role configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>user/</var></td>
      <td>User configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><var>plugin.properties</var></td>
      <td>The plug-in configuration file (mandatory, see below)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>

<p>The directories are names according to the type of objects contained. The
exceptions being <var>files</var> and <var>lib</var> that are handled in a
special way. The <var>files</var> contains all the JavaScript code and images
to make available to web browsers.</p>


<h2 id="plugin_config">5.2. Plug-in Configuration</h2>

<p>Each plug-in must contain a <var>plugin.properties</var> configuration file.
It is the only mandatory content of a plug-in and consists of the following
fields:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>id</var> &mdash; The unique plug-in identifier. May only contain
      ASCII alphanumeric characters without spaces or separators.</li>
  <li><var>name</var> &mdash; The plug-in name as presented to the users.</li>
  <li><var>version</var> &mdash; The plug-in version number. This number is
      automatically modified if the Ant script in <var>plugin-build.xml</var>
      is used for packaging the plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>date</var> &mdash; The plug-in build date. This number is
      automatically set if the Ant script in <var>plugin-build.xml</var> is
      used for packaging the plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>description</var> &mdash; The optional description text that
      explains the functionality in provided by the plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>copyright</var> &mdash; The optional copyright statement text.</li>
  <li><var>className</var> &mdash; The optional fully qualified name of
      a Java class that handles the plug-in life-cycle. The class must be a
      subclass of <var>org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.Plugin</var>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plug-in configuration is the first file to write when developing a
plug-in. An example <var>plugin.properties</var> file is shown below:</p>

<pre class="box blue code">
<span class="comment"># General properties</span>
id = example
name = Example Plug-in
version = 1.0
date =
description = Provides tests and examples for the platform.
className = org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.example.ExamplePlugin
</pre>

<p>Once the <var>plugin.properties</var> file has been created, the Ant script
in <var>plugin-build.xml</var> can be used for packaging the plug-in.</p>


<h2 id="procedures">5.3. Procedures &amp; Procedure Types</h2>

<p>Server-side operations can be added by creating <strong>procedures</strong>.
Procedures can be invoked from the client or from other procedures and may take
arguments, modify data and/or return values.</p>

<p>Each procedure has a specific type (or kind). The procedure type defines
which Java code is used to execute the procedure, similar to a templating
engine. Since most server-side operations very similar, only a few different
procedure types are needed. The built-in and standard plug-in procedure types
are listed below, but more can be added by installing additional plug-ins.</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>built-in</var> &mdash; The built-in procedure type, used for one-off
      procedures implemented directly in Java code. This type is normally only
      used for platform operations.</li>
  <li><var>cmdline.exec</var> &mdash; The command-line execution procedure
      type, used for running shell commands on the server. Procedure arguments
      can used as arguments on the command-line.</li>
  <li><var>http.post</var> &mdash; The HTTP POST request procedure type, used
      for sending data to a receiving URL. Procedure arguments can be inserted
      into either the request headers and/or data payload.</li>
  <li><var>javascript</var> &mdash; The JavaScript procedure type, used for
      building a procedure in JavaScript (usually to provide business logic and
      smarts to more basic procedures). Procedure arguments are available as
      global variables during execution.</li>
  <li><var>jdbc.query</var> &mdash; The JDBC query procedure type, used for
      SQL SELECT queries returning results. Procedure arguments may be inserted
      as literals into the SQL text.</li>
  <li><var>jdbc.statement</var> &mdash; The JDBC statement procedure type, used
      for SQL INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements (among others). Procedure
      arguments may be inserted as literals into the SQL text.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="procedure_editing">5.4. Procedure Editing</h2>

<p>Using the <strong>Admin</strong> app, it is easy to create or edit
procedures of any type (except <var>built-in</var>). The screenshot below
shows the location of the <q>+</q> icon for adding a new procedure. Just next
to it is the edit icon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/screenshot-procedure-buttons.png" />
</p>

<p>After clicking the add or edit icon, the following dialog is shown:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/screenshot-procedure-edit.png" />
</p>

<p>Each procedure can have a number of custom configuration properties that
control their execution. A property has one of four types, each with different
semantics and expected values:</p>

<ol class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Argument</strong> &mdash; The value should contain the procedure
      argument description (as later shown in the <strong>Admin</strong> app).
      Note that both the number and order of arguments are important. During
      procedure execution, the property identifier is bound to the value
      provided in the call.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection</strong> &mdash; The value should contain a connection
      identifier (connection reference). The connection will be reserved before
      calling the procedure. For JavaScript procedures, the connection object
      allows direct calls to methods such as <var>commit()</var> or
      similar.</li>
  <li><strong>Data</strong> &mdash; The value is a data string constant that
      may or may not span multiple lines. Mostly useful for JavaScript
      procedures.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedure</strong> &mdash; The value contains a procedure
      identifier (procedure reference). Only used for JavaScript procedures,
      where it enables calling other procedures as functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Procedures created or edited are stored to the <var>procedure/</var>
directory inside the <var>local</var> plug-in. The files there can be copied to
the corresponding plug-in development development for packaging.</p>


<h2 id="javascript">5.5. JavaScript Procedures</h2>

<p>The <var>javascript</var> procedure type allows creating generic server-side
logic with minimum effort. The procedure consists of JavaScript code, which is
compiled upon the first call. Additional procedure properties are exposed as
variables in the global scope and can be accessed or called directly.</p>

<p>The JavaScript environment provided is compatible with EcmaScript 5.1 and
allows the creation of helper functions and comments to keep the code readable.
See the example below for a JavaScript procedure that calls another procedure
and filters its result:</p>

<pre class="box blue code">
<span class="comment">// Helper: Check if server thread has context</span>
function hasContext(thread) {
    return thread.context != null;
}

<span class="comment">// Helper: Extract procedure name from server thread context</span>
function getProcName(thread) {
    return thread.context.procedure;
}

<span class="comment">// Using property bound to 'System.Thread.List' procedure</span>
var threads = listThreads();

<span class="comment">// Filter threads and extract procedure names,</span>
return threads.filter(hasContext).map(getProcName);
</pre>

<p>Using JavaScript procedures is a powerful tool for post-processing data in
various ways. And it is often easier and more efficient to put this
functionality into a procedure than to perform it in the web browser.
Especially when the data set is large or when many separate queries are
required. Here are a number of recommended uses for JavaScript procedures:</p>

<ol class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Data Filtering</strong> &mdash; Perform additional checks to
      remove items from a list is easy with the JavaScript <var>filter()</var>
      method. Some checks are also much easier to express in JavaScript than in
      SQL or similar.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Merging</strong> &mdash; Merging data from multiple queries
      and/or data sources is straight-forward in JavaScript. The easiest way is
      of course to just return a new object with all results as properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Transformation</strong> &mdash; Transforming data from a
      list to a lookup table is just a matter of writing a <var>for</var> or a
      <var>while</var> loop. But the possibilties are really endless here.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher-Order Searches</strong> &mdash; Using a bit of JavaScript,
      it is possible to build higher-order searches that use the results from
      one query as input to the next one. Since a JavaScript procedure can
      use many other procedures, results can be tailored in any way.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistics</strong> &mdash; If the data source itself cannot
      perform adequate statistical functions, the next best option is to use a
      procedure. The transfer of large quantities of data is costly, so
      processing closer to the data source is faster.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few additional tips to consider when developing JavaScript procedures:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Debugging</strong> &mdash; When creating or modifying JavaScript
      procedures, it is often very helpful to switch on trace logging. See the
      <q>Logging</q> tab in the <strong>Admin</strong> app for controlling
      this.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection Reservation</strong> &mdash;  All connections required
      by a procedure and <em>all its referenced sub-procedures</em> are
      reserved before the execution starts. This guarantees that all resources
      are available, but might be wasteful in some circumstances.</li>
</ul>
