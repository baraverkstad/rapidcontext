<h1>5. Server-side &amp; Plug-In Development</h1>

<h2 id="plugin_struct">5.1 Plug-in Structure</h2>

<p>All RapidContext server functionality is provided by plug-ins. The plug-ins
are distributed as ZIP files named
<var>[plugin identifier]-[version].plugin</var> and contain an internal
directory structure like this (mirroring the overall storage structure):</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><var>app/</var></td>
        <td>App configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>connection/</var></td>
        <td>Connection configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>environment/</var></td>
        <td>Environment configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>files/</var></td>
        <td>Contains files to serve via HTTP (maps directly to URL:s)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>lib/</var></td>
        <td>Java JAR libraries to load (server-side)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>procedure/</var></td>
        <td>Procedure configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>role/</var></td>
        <td>Role configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>user/</var></td>
        <td>User configuration files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><var>plugin.properties</var></td>
        <td>The plug-in configuration file (mandatory, see below)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The directories are names according to the type of objects contained. The
exceptions being <var>files/</var> and <var>lib/</var> that are handled in a
special way. The <var>files/</var> directory contains public files (images,
CSS, JavaScript and HTML) available to web browsers.</p>


<h2 id="plugin_config">5.2 Plug-in Configuration</h2>

<p>Each plug-in must contain a <var>plugin.properties</var> configuration file.
It is the only mandatory content of a plug-in and consists of the following
fields:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>id</var> &mdash; The unique plug-in identifier. May only contain
      ASCII alphanumeric characters without spaces or separators.</li>
  <li><var>name</var> &mdash; The plug-in name as presented to the users.</li>
  <li><var>version</var> &mdash; The plug-in version number. This number is
      automatically modified by the default build tools (in <var>share/plugin</var>).</li>
  <li><var>date</var> &mdash; The plug-in build date. This number is
      automatically set by the default build tools (in <var>share/plugin</var>).</li>
  <li><var>description</var> &mdash; The optional description text that
      explains the functionality provided by the plug-in.</li>
  <li><var>copyright</var> &mdash; The optional copyright statement text.</li>
  <li><var>className</var> &mdash; The optional fully qualified name of
      a Java class that handles the plug-in life-cycle. The class must be a
      subclass of <var>org.rapidcontext.core.type.Plugin</var>.</li>
  <li><var>post-install</var> &mdash; The optional procedure that should be
      called after each installation (for validation, upgrade or similar).</li>
</ul>

<p>The plug-in configuration is the first file to write when developing a
plug-in. An example <var>plugin.properties</var> file is shown below:</p>

<div class="box blue">
  <i class="box-icon fa fa-fw fa-code"></i>
  <pre class="box-content code">
<span class="comment"># General properties</span>
id = example
name = Example Plug-in
version = 1.0
date =
description = Provides tests and examples for the platform.
className = org.rapidcontext.app.plugin.example.ExamplePlugin
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Once the <var>plugin.properties</var> file has been created, the build tools
in <var>share/plugin</var> can be used for packaging the plug-in (using a
<var>Makefile</var> or an Ant <var>build.xml</var> file).</p>


<h2 id="procedures">5.3 Procedures &amp; Procedure Types</h2>

<p>Server-side operations can be added by creating <strong>procedures</strong>.
Procedures can be invoked from the client or from other procedures and may take
arguments, modify data and/or return values.</p>

<p>Each procedure has a specific type (its storage type). The procedure type
defines which Java code is used to execute the procedure, similar to a
templating engine. Since most server-side operations are very similar, only a
few different procedure types are needed. The built-in and standard plug-in
procedure types are listed below, but more can be added by installing
additional plug-ins.</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><var>procedure</var> &mdash; The base procedure type, only used by
      procedures implemented directly in Java code.</li>
  <li><var>procedure/javascript</var> &mdash; The JavaScript procedure type,
      used for creating a procedure in JavaScript (usually to provide business
      logic and smarts for more basic procedures).</li>
  <li><var>procedure/cmdline/exec</var> &mdash; The command-line execution
      procedure type, used for running shell commands on the server. Procedure
      arguments can used as arguments on the command-line.</li>
  <li><var>procedure/http/request</var> &mdash; The HTTP request procedure type,
      used for fetching from or posting to a URL. Procedure arguments can be
      inserted into either the request headers and/or data payload.</li>
  <li><var>procedure/jdbc/query</var> &mdash; The JDBC query procedure type,
      used for SQL SELECT queries returning results. Procedure arguments may be
      inserted as literals into the SQL text.</li>
  <li><var>procedure/jdbc/statement</var> &mdash; The JDBC statement procedure
      type, used for SQL INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements (among others).
      Procedure arguments may be inserted as literals into the SQL text.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="procedure_editing">5.4 Procedure Editing</h2>

<p>Using the <strong>Admin</strong> app, it is easy to create or edit
procedures of any type (except <var>built-in</var>). The screenshot below
shows the location of the <q>+</q> icon for adding a new procedure. Just next
to it is the edit icon.</p>

<p class="text-center">
  <img src="images/screenshot-procedure-buttons.png">
</p>

<p>After clicking the add or edit icon, the following dialog is shown:</p>

<p class="text-center">
  <img src="images/screenshot-procedure-edit.png">
</p>

<p>Each procedure is configured with a number of bindings (properties) that
control the execution. Each binding has a <var>type</var> that controls how
the binding is used during execution:</p>

<ol class="box yellow">
  <li><var>data</var> &mdash; The binding <var>value</var> is a string constant
      that may or may not span multiple lines. Typically contains SQL text or
      JavaScript code.</li>
  <li><var>connection</var> &mdash; The binding <var>value</var> is a connection
      identifier (i.e. a storage path without the <var>connection/</var>
      prefix). The connection will automatically be reserved before calling the
      procedure. For JavaScript procedures, a connection object exposes an API
      for direct calls to <var>commit()</var> or other methods.</li>
  <li><var>procedure</var> &mdash; The binding <var>value</var> is a procedure
      identifier (i.e. a storage path without the <var>procedure/</var>
      prefix). Only used for JavaScript procedures, where it exposes these as
      callable functions.</li>
  <li><var>argument</var> &mdash; The binding <var>value</var> is normally not
      set, but must be provided when the procedure is called. A binding
      <var>description</var> contains the argument description (as shown in the
      <strong>Admin</strong> app). Note that both the number and order of
      arguments are important. During execution the binding <var>name</var>
      variable is set to the value provided in the call.</li>
</ol>

<p>Procedures created or edited are stored to the <var>procedure/</var>
directory inside the <var>local</var> plug-in. The files there can be copied to
the corresponding plug-in development directory for packaging.</p>


<h2 id="javascript">5.5 JavaScript Procedures</h2>

<p>The <var>procedure/javascript</var> type allows creating generic server-side
logic with minimum effort. The procedure consists of JavaScript code, which is
compiled upon the first call. Additional procedure properties are exposed as
variables in the global scope and can be accessed or called directly.</p>

<p>The JavaScript environment provided is compatible with EcmaScript 5.1 and
allows the creation of helper functions and comments to keep the code readable.
See the example below for a JavaScript procedure that calls another procedure
and filters its result:</p>

<div class="box blue">
  <i class="box-icon fa fa-fw fa-code"></i>
  <pre class="box-content code">
<span class="comment">// Helper: Check if server thread has context</span>
function hasContext(thread) {
    return thread.context != null;
}

<span class="comment">// Helper: Extract procedure name from server thread context</span>
function getProcName(thread) {
    return thread.context.procedure;
}

<span class="comment">// Using property bound to 'system/thread/list' procedure</span>
var threads = listThreads();

<span class="comment">// Filter threads and extract procedure names,</span>
return threads.filter(hasContext).map(getProcName);
  </pre>
</div>

<p>JavaScript procedures is a powerful tool for post-processing data in various
situations. It is also often easier and more efficient to put this type of
functionality into a procedure, than to perform it in the web browser.
Especially when the data set is large or when many separate queries are
required. Here are a number of recommended uses for JavaScript procedures:</p>

<ol class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Data Filtering</strong> &mdash; Perform additional checks to
      remove items from a list is easy with the JavaScript <var>filter()</var>
      method. Some checks are also much easier to express in JavaScript than in
      SQL or similar.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Merging</strong> &mdash; Merging data from multiple queries
      and/or data sources is straight-forward in JavaScript. The easiest way is
      of course to just return a new object with all results as properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Transformation</strong> &mdash; Transforming data from one
      format to another is often easy with a bit of JavaScript. Using a simple
      <var>for</var> or <var>while</var> loop, any data list can easily be
      transformed into a lookup table for example.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher-Order Searches</strong> &mdash; Using a bit of JavaScript,
      it is possible to build higher-order searches that use the results from
      one query as input to the next one. Since a JavaScript procedure can
      use many other procedures, results can be tailored in any way.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistics</strong> &mdash; If the data source itself cannot
      perform adequate statistical functions, the next best option is to use a
      procedure. The transfer of large quantities of data is costly, so
      processing closer to the data source is faster.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few additional tips to consider when developing JavaScript procedures:</p>

<ul class="box yellow">
  <li><strong>Debugging</strong> &mdash; When creating or modifying JavaScript
      procedures, it is often very helpful to switch on trace logging. See the
      <q>Logging</q> tab in the <strong>Admin</strong> app for controlling
      this.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection Reservation</strong> &mdash;  All connections required
      by a procedure (and its referenced sub-procedures) are reserved before
      execution starts. This guarantees that resources are available, but might
      be wasteful in some circumstances.</li>
</ul>
