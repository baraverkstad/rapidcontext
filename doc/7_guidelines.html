<h1>7. Development Guidelines</h1>

<h2 id="usage">7.1. Design Principle Usage</h2>

<p>This chapter lists of some of the key principles guiding the design of
RapidContext. It is an attempt to explain some of the trade-offs, omissions and
choices made for the platform.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          Read this document as the RapidContext declaration of <q>good
          taste</q>, whatever that means. Consider the <q>pattern</q> examples as
          templates.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          Do not read this as a set of absolute principles that can never be
          broken. The <q>anti-pattern</q> examples show that they already have
          been.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="less_is_more">7.2. Less is More</h2>

<p>The less code that is written, the less code needs to be maintained,
corrected and refactored. By omitting difficult, poorly designed or rarely used
features, time and focus can be shifted to more pressing needs.</p>

<p>Also, by not including poorly designed API:s in the product, it is possible
to revisit the omitted feature at a later date. Hopefully with a better
understanding, more realistic use cases and/or a better design proposal.</p>

<p>This principle is sometimes referred to as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The built-in transaction support is limited to the most commonly used
          scenario. Code and work-arounds are required for other behaviours.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          Built-in support for procedure call interceptors and more...
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="declarative">7.3. Declarative over Imperative</h2>

<p>Using a declarative language over an imperative one has a number of
advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The source code becomes less verbose and easier to read</li>
  <li>The data might be reused for other purposes</li>
  <li>The data might become readable by non-developers</li>
</ol>

<p>These advantages are especially valid for configuration parameters, data
transformations or similar.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The user interface XML (<var>ui.xml</var>) format is less verbose and
          easier to read than JavaScript code (imperative) for the same thing.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          Custom widgets are still not possible to create using XML, but require
          everything to be done in JavaScript code.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="simplicity">7.4. Simplicity over Documentation</h2>

<p>An application that is simple or easy to use doesn't require much (if any)
documentation. Using tooltips or small in-app help texts in the user interface,
reduces the need for user guide or screenshot sequences.</p>

<p>Note that simplification of the user interface is not identical to reducing
the number of feature or making development easier. On the contrary, simplicity
often requires much hard work with auto-detection, generalization and various
smart tricks in the interface. Generally, only the <strong>illusion of
simplicity</strong> is desired.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The automatic detection of <var>java</var> location and available port
          number when launching the RapidContext server.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          Creating new apps and plug-ins still can't be done without access to
          the manual or by copying from other apps or plug-ins.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="defaults">7.5. Defaults over Configuration</h2>

<p>Sensible default values should be used instead of forcing users to configure
the application. When in doubt, use defaults suitable for the majority or for
the least technically inclined.</p>

<p>This principle is also applicable when designing API:s, where common use
cases should be made as simple as possible. This is sometimes referred to as
<strong>optimizing for the common case</strong>.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The default <var>admin</var> user is created with a blank password when
          no other users are configured.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          The app and plug-in configurations are mostly identical and should be
          possible to omit, using heuristics to set the defaults.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="implementation">7.6. Implementation over Specification</h2>

<p>Most concepts and features are better understood after creating a working
implementation with real-world data, rather than by writing a specification.
<strong>Working code is preferred over ideas</strong>.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be confused with the good practice of providing example data
and interactions (use cases) before starting the implementation.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          Implement new ideas or behaviors as plug-ins. If they prove useful, the
          core extensions may be suitable for inclusion in the platform.
        </td>
        <td class="unimportant pl-3">
          No current example found
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="dynamic_types">7.7. Dynamic over Strict Types</h2>

<p>This issue has been debated at length elsewhere. Suffice to say here that
dynamic types is a core feature in JavaScript (and many other
productivity-improving languages), so it makes sense to try to take this into
account when building Java code for RapidContext.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The generic <var>Dict</var> and <var>Array</var> classes add some
          generic duck-typing to Java. They also simplify serializing to JSON,
          HTML or <var>.properties</var> files.
        </td>
        <td class="pl-3">
          The Java implementation of built-in procedures or procedure types still
          require a number of specific interfaces and classes that are rather
          strict.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 id="testing">7.8. Exploratory over Automated Testing</h2>

<p>Automated testing is unsuitable for discovering usability or deployment
issues, due to its controlled and automated environment. Also, the time
required for writing scripted tests is often better spent performing ad hoc
testing of apps and procedures. This is especially true for the type of
fast-moving software that RapidContext encourages.</p>

<div class="box yellow">
  <table class="w-100">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pr-3">Pattern</th>
        <th scope="col" class="w-50 pl-3">Anti-Pattern</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="pr-3">
          The <strong>Admin</strong> app makes ad-hoc testing (calls) of
          procedures easy and straight-forward.
        </td>
        <td class="unimportant pl-3">
          No current example found
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
