    <title>RapidContext :: Users &amp; Security</title>
  </head>

  <body>

<h1>Users &amp; Security</h1>

<p>RapidContext requires all users to authenticate with username and password.
The user information is available for logging and is also used to check all
procedure calls before execution. By default the platform requires
administrative privileges for any operation that modifies the configuration
or accesses sensitive information.</p>


<h2>1. Default Users &amp; Roles</h2>

<p>The default installation of RapidContext contain the following users
and roles:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong><code>admin</code> (user)</strong> &ndash; Created if no other users are
      detected on server startup. The password is initially set to accept
      any value (blank string) and has the <code>Admin</code> role.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Admin</code> (role)</strong> &ndash; A built-in role that provides
      full system access. This role is required in order to modify procedures,
      install plug-ins, and similar adminirative operations.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. User Authentication</h2>

<p>In the standard configuration, user authentication is supported by the
following protocols:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong>HTTP Basic Auth</strong> &ndash; Uses browser built-in login
      dialog for user authentication. Note that the user name and password
      will be sent unencrypted over the wire, so the communication channel
      must be secure (intranet, VPN tunnel or HTTPS is recommended).</li>
</ul>

<p>After successful authentication, the user credentials are stored in the
HTTP session. This avoids repeated authentication requests and makes other
authentication methods feasible (provided by plug-ins).</p>

<p class="box"><strong>Note:</strong> By default the HTTP sessions are
configured to expire after 4 hours of inactivity. The sessions may also be
forcefully terminated with the <code>System.Session.Terminate</code>
procedure.</p>


<h2>3. Managing Users</h2>

<p>Users are managed with the <strong>Admin</strong> application, in the
<strong>Users</strong> tab. Below is a screenshot showing the editing
of the default <code>admin</code> user:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="screenshot-user-edit.png" />
</p>

<p>New and modified user are automatically stored in the <code>local</code>
plug-in, under the <code>plugins/local/user</code> directory. A few important
facts should be noted regarding the storage of user data:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong>Passwords</strong> &ndash; Passwords are stored with a one-way
      SHA-256 hash (with salting). This makes it virtually impossible to
      retrieve passwords other than by guessing. An administrator can of
      course reset user passwords if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>User Removal</strong> &ndash; Users can be removed by deleting
      the corresponding file in the plug-in <code>user</code> directory.
      This is discouraged since it makes unintentional reuse of user names
      possible. Use the <strong>enabled</strong> flag instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Default Reset</strong> &ndash; By removing or renaming all
      plug-in <code>user</code> directories and restarting the server, the
      default <code>admin</code> user is recreated. This is useful to
      reset a server.</li>
</ul>


<h2>4. Roles &amp; Access Control</h2>

<p>User roles are by default only possible to create or modify by accessing
the corresponding data files in the <code>plugins/&lt;plugin id&gt;/role</code>
directory. The files are named <code>&lt;name&gt;.properties</code>. See below
for a simple example role file.</p>

<pre class="box code">
<span class="comment"># General properties</span>
name = Demo
description = Provides access to all read-only procedures (if properly named).

<span class="comment"># Access array</span>
access.0.type = procedure
access.0.regexp = .*\\.Find[^.]*
</pre>

<p>All procedure calls are authorized (permission checked) based on the roles
that a user has. The <code>Admin</code> role automatically provides access to
all procedures, but other roles use the configured <code>access</code> array
in the role data file.</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><code>access.#.type</code> &ndash; The object type to match. Only the
      <code>procedure</code> type is currently recognized and used in default
      access controls. Use a prefix <code>&lt;plugin id&gt;:</code> for custom
      permission types used in generic access controls.</li>
  <li><code>access.#.name</code> &ndash; The exact object name to match, e.g.
      the procedure name. Either this property or the <code>regexp</code>
      property must be specified. Use the <code>name</code> property when a
      single unique object is to be identified.</li>
  <li><code>access.#.regexp</code> &ndash; The regular expression object name
      to match. Either this property or the <code>name</code> property must be
      specified. Note that the "." character has special meaning when using
      regular expressions, so it must be escaped with a single "\"
      character.</li>
  <li><code>access.#.caller</code> &ndash; The regular expression caller name
      to match. If this property is specified, the procedure will only be
      accessible when executed by the matched caller procedure. This is useful
      for limiting access to generic helper procedures.</li>
  <li><code>access.#.allow</code> &ndash; The access permission value, defaults
      to <code>true</code>. The permission access list is processed in order,
      so once an object matches an access list entry, the value of the
      <code>allow</code> property will be returned as the permission check
      result.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since only procedures are permission checked by default, other object
accesses must be programmatically checked (from JavaScript procedures) by
using the <code>System.User.CheckAccess</code> procedure.</p>

<p class="box"><strong>Note:</strong> When using programmatic access checks,
care must be taken to ensure that no procedures are exposed that allow direct
access to the protected data or operation. Make sure to use wrapper JavaScript
procedures and the <code>caller</code> access list property to protect the
direct access to resources.</p>


<h2>5. Security Checklist</h2>

<p>Before installing a RapidContext server in a publically acessible location,
please check the following:</p>

<ul class="box">
  <li><strong>Disable Default User</strong> &ndash; Make sure that the
      <strong>admin</strong> user is either removed, disabled or provided with
      a strong password.</li>
  <li><strong>Check User Passwords</strong> &ndash; All users should have
      strong passwords to avoid brute-force attacks with password guessing.</li>
  <li><strong>Encrypt Connection</strong> &ndash; Communication over the
      internet must be encrypted, since passwords and data can otherwise be
      eavesdropped. Either use an HTTPS proxy, an HTTPS servlet container or
      a VPN tunnel.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Access Controls</strong> &ndash; The access controls for
      each role must be checked to verify that no private resources are
      available to unprivileged users.</li>
  <li><strong>Limit Admin Access</strong> &ndash; The number of users with
      the <code>Admin</code> role should be limited, to avoid potential abuse
      of the system.</li>
</ul>
