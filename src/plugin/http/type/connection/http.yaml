description: >-
    The HTTP connection type. HTTP connections are only used for sharing
    connection parameters between procedures, to avoid duplication. The actual
    HTTP connections are created once for each HTTP call, without any
    connection reuse (not even HTTP connection keep-alive). There is no support
    for HTTP connection pooling or limitations.
