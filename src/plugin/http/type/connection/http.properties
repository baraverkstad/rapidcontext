# General properties
id = connection/http
type = type
description = The HTTP connection type. HTTP connections are only used for \
    storing and sharing HTTP connection parameters instead of repeating them \
    in each HTTP procedure. The actual HTTP (TCP/IP) connections are not \
    managed by the HTTP connection, but rather in the HTTP procedures. There \
    is therefore no support for pooling of HTTP connections.
