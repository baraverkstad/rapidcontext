# General properties
id = connection/http
type = type
description = The HTTP connection type. HTTP connections are only used for \
    sharing connection parameters between procedures, to avoid duplication. \
    The actual HTTP connections are created once for each HTTP call, without \
    any connection reuse (not even HTTP connection keep-alive). There is no \
    support for HTTP connection pooling or limitations.
