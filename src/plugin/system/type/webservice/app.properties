description = An app web service. This service extends the file web service \
    with a default app launcher at "/" and a number of RapidContext APIs \
    available under the "/rapidcontext/" path. Note that both HTTP GET and \
    POST support is required (at a minimum).

property.0.format = text
property.1.name = app

property.2.name = login
property.2.description = The app identifier to launch for non-authorized \

property.3.description = Optional HTML header lines to include in the default \
    app launcher template. This can be used for specifying favicon images and \
    similar. Note that JavaScript and CSS resources are loaded automatically, \
    so they needn't be specified here.
