    with a RapidContext API and a default app launcher page. The API pages \
    are available under the "/rapidcontext/" path. Note that both HTTP GET \
    and POST support is required (at a minimum).

property.0.description = The storage path to service. Should be prefixed with \
    '/files/', since it may be a security risk to expose other objects.

property.1.name = app
property.1.description = The app identifier for the default launcher. If an \
    "index.html" file exists in the storage root, it will be returned instead \
