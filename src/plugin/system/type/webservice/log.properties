description = A logging web service. This service is used for server-side \
    logging of client-side events. The request parameters "level", "message" \
    and "data" are used to create the log entry. One or more log events can \
    also be sent as JSON (using 'appliction/json' MIME type for HTTP POST). \
    Either as single object or an array or objects are supported. The JSON \
    objects use the same "level", "message" and "data" properties.
