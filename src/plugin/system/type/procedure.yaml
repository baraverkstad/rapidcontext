id: procedure
type: type
description: >-
    A server-side function or operation. Procedures may take arguments, modify
    data and/or return values. They can be invoked either server-side or
    client-side (via API) if permissions allow.

    This generic type is used only for direct Java implementations. A number
    of subtypes allows creating procedures from configurable parameters (e.g.
    SQL text, HTTP requests, etc) instead, sharing a common reusable Java
    implementation. When implementing procedures in Java, care must be taken so
    that all operations are properly checked for security.
