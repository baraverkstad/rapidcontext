id: procedure
type: type
description: >-
    A server-side function or operation. Procedures may take arguments, modify
    data and/or return values. They can be invoked either server-side or
    client-side (via API) if permissions allow.\n
    \n
    This generic type is used only for direct Java implementations. A number
    of subtypes allows creating procedures from configurable parameters (e.g.
    SQL text, HTTP requests, etc) instead, sharing a common reusable Java
    implementation. When implementing procedures in Java, care must be taken so
    that all operations are properly checked for security.

        The array of bindings, listing all resources required during execution.
        Each binding is an object with 'name', 'type', 'description' and
        'value' properties, some being optional depending on the bining type.
        The four available binding types are \u2014 'data', 'procedure',
