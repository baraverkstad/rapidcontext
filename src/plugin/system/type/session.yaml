description: >-
    An active client session. The session can be either authenticated (for a
    single user) or anonymous. It allows a client to store uploaded files and
    avoid re-authenticating on each request. The browser instead sends a
    persistent HTTP cookie identifying the session. Sessions are created when
    applications are launched and a user may have multiple active sessions in
    different web browsers.
