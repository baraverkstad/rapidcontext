/**
 * An add-on procedure base class. All procedures that are not
 * built-in must extend this base class, since it serves as a marker
 * for standard security, modification and serialization support. It
 * also provides default implementations for some of the methods in
 * the procedure interface. Subclasses to this class should meet the
 * following requirements:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class must have a public constructor taking no arguments.
 * <li>The constructor should only throw ProcedureException:s.
 * <li>A unique procedure type name must be registered for the
 *     procedure class. See Library.registerProcedureType().
 * <li>All configurable aspects of the procedure must be stored as
 *     string values in the default procedure bindings. This is the
 *     only procedure data handled in the serialization process.
 * <li>The procedure should preferably not manage connections to
 *     other systems by itself when called. A better model is to use
 *     declared adapter connection pool names, which is handled
 *     transparently by the framework.
 * </ul>
