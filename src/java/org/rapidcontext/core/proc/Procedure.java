/**
 * A procedure that can be called for execution from the public API.
 * Normally a procedure wraps a parameterized call to an external
 * system (such as an SQL query), but more complex procedures are
 * also possible using JavaScript.<p>
 *
 * There are two types of procedures &mdash; add-on and built-in.
 * The add-on procedures are created and modified by the user with a
 * set of configurable parameters (e.g. SQL text, connection pool
 * names, etc). The built-in procedures are basically singleton
 * procedures that cannot be modified by the user. The latter type
 * provides services needed by the platform, such as introspection,
 * administration and control.<p>
 *
 * Each procedure has a number of bindings, containing any resources
 * required during execution. The bindings have different types to
 * clarify their content, such as input argument, static data,
 * adapter pool name or referenced procedure name.<p>
 *
 * Most classes implementing this interface should be subclasses of
 * the AddOnProcedure class and follow the requirements for
 * serialization and configurability defined by that class.
 * Otherwise the procedure is considered a built-in procedure and is
 * responsible for its own initialization and security checks. Great
 * care must be taken when implementing this interface so that any
 * sensitive operation is properly checked for security.
 *

 * @see Bindings
