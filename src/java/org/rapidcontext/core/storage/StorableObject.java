/**
 * The base class for all storable Java objects. This class provides
 * a number of basic services required for managing objects in the
 * storage subsystem:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Object Type</strong> -- The object type identifies
 *       the kind of object, e.g. "index", "file", "plugin", etc. By
 *       registering a Java class corresponding to an object type,
 *       the instance creation is handled automatically when a new
 *       object is loaded from storage.
 *   <li><strong>Object Id</strong> -- The object identifier is used
 *       to locate the object in a storage. The full object storage
 *       path is normally formed as "&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;". Note
 *       that the object id may contain additional "/" characters.
 *   <li><strong>Serialization</strong> -- A data dictionary instance
 *       is encapsulated to enable simple and efficient serialization
 *       and unserialization of object instances. It is recommended
 *       to store all persistent data in this dictionary, although
 *       both serialization and unserialization can be overridden.
 *   <li><strong>Life-cycle Handling</strong> -- Object instances are
 *       initialized, destroyed and cached automatically by the root
 *       storage. Whenever an instance reports being inactive, it is
 *       eligible for automatic removal (destruction) from the cache.
 * </ul>
