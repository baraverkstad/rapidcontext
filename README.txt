RapidContext README
===================

1. Introduction
---------------
  RapidContext is a platform for creating rich dynamic web applications.
  It consists of both a client and a server part, providing a simple,
  safe and stable way to build applications that can connect to a wide
  range of back-end services.


2. Installation & Usage
-----------------------
  On Linux, Mac OS & Unix the following commands will unpack the
  distributed package and start the server:

    #> unzip rapidcontext-<version>.zip
    #> cd rapidcontext-<version>
    #> bin/rapidcontext

  On Windows, perform the following steps:

    # Unpack rapidcontext-<version>.zip
    # Open the directory rapidcontext-<version>/bin
    # Double-click rapidcontext.bat

  Once the server has been started, a web browser pointing to one
  of the following addresses should be able to launch a client:

    http://localhost/
    http://localhost:8080/
    http://localhost:8180/
    http://localhost:8081/

  If this is a blank installation, login with the following user
  credentials:

    Login:     admin
    Password:  <blank>
